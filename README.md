MIIS is a perfect blend between a traditional CMS (such as Wordpress) and a Static Site Generator (such as Jekyll). Get the best of both worlds:

- No backend database or special setup needed
- No need to recompile and deploy after any change
- Lightning-fast, without unneeded bloat

**Set up your Markdown-based documentation system or web site in less than 30 seconds!**

- Super-flexible and easy template creation, with "includes" support

- Define different look&feel, layout or navigation for specific files or folders
